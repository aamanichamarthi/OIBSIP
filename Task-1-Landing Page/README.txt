A landing page is a standalone web page that a person "lands" on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location.
Once a user is on your landing page, they are encouraged to join your list or buy your products.
1.I created this landing page using HTML and CSS.
2.In this landing page, I have used external CSS. The '<title>' tag sets the title of the webpage that will be displayed in the browser's title bar.
3.The '<header>' section contains the main content of the webpage's header, including a navigation bar and a background image.
4.The navigation bar is defined within the '<nav>' tag and has a fixed height of 100 pixels. It is styled with a light sky blue background color and contains a logo and a menu.
5.The menu items are defined within the <div class="menu"> element and styled as dashed underlined text with black color.
6.The background image is set using the CSS class "background-image" and positioned to cover the entire viewport.
7.The text content within the header, including headings and a button, is contained in the <div class="htext"> element. It is positioned absolutely with respect to the header and aligned to the top left.
8.The headings are styled with different font sizes and colors, with the second heading having a span element with a rebeccapurple color.
9.The button is styled with padding, background color, and font size, and it appears as an inline block element with a light pink background.
