A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. Itâ€™s a platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you.
1.I created this website using HTML and CSS.
2.In this portfolio I have used external CSS.The CSS file is linked using the <link> tag, specifying the file name as "style2.css".
3.The <header> section contains the main content of the webpage's header, including a navigation bar and a heading.
4.The navigation bar is defined within the <nav> tag and styled to have a logo on the left and menu links on the right.
5.The text content within the header, including the heading, is contained in the <div class="htext"> element and styled accordingly.
6.The <main> section contains different sections for the about, skills, projects, and contact information.
7.Each section is defined within a <section> tag and has a unique ID for linking purposes. They are styled using the "container" class and have their respective content.
8.The CSS file contains various styles, including background images, font families, positioning, alignment, and responsiveness.
9.The form in the contact section is styled with form groups for each input field, and the submit button has custom styling. The CSS file also includes hover effects for buttons.
