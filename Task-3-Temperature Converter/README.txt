Temperature Converter website deals with temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit & Kelvin using HTML CSS & JavaScript. The Temperature is generally measured in terms of unit degree., i.e. in degree centigrade, in degrees, Fahrenheit & Kelvin.

Celsius is a standard unit of temperature on the Celsius scale, & is represented by the °C symbol.
Fahrenheit uses the degree Fahrenheit as the unit & is represented with the °F symbol.
Kelvin is an internationally recognized standard for scientific temperature measurement. It is an absolute temperature scale that is obtained by shifting the Celsius scale by −273.15°, in order to coincide the absolute zero to 0K.
1.I created this website using HTML,CSS,JS.
2.In this website I have used external CSS.The CSS file is linked using the <link> tag, specifying the file name as "style3.css".
3.The <body> section contains a container div with a title, input fields for temperature and unit selection, a convert button, and a result div.
4.The CSS file provides styles for the container, heading, input container, input fields, button, and result section.
5.The JavaScript code is included using the <script> tag, specifying the file name as "script3.js".
6.The JavaScript code defines a function convertTemperature() which is called when the convert button is clicked.
7.The function retrieves the input values, validates the temperature, and performs temperature conversion based on the selected unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
8.The converted values are displayed in the result div by updating its inner HTML.
